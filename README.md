# Materials Collection Dashboard to Assist Scraplanta with Donation Activities
This application supports the non-profit Scraplanta by innovating their donation intake process as well as by providing multiple avenues for visualizing the impact they have through receiving donations.

# üîß Technologies Used
## Frontend: React Native/Expo
React Native along with the Expo framework provides an optimal way of developing an application across platforms (iOS, Android, Web) within a single development environment. Expo Go allows for testing for the application on native devices without deploying the application.
## Backend: Javascript/Node.js
For the purposes of the artifact demo, our application connects directly with the Firestore database. However, for future implementations, we could employ Node.js on the back end with the Express framework to create an API that's fast and handles real-time updates efficiently for our donation logging.
## Database: Firebase Firestore
Firestore meets the cost needs for the application while offering a powerful cloud database that can be scaled as needed. It also requires very little maintenance, and provides built-in security and authentication/authorization features that help make it secure and powerful.

# üìÑ Release Notes
## v0.0.0 Release
### Features
#### Logging Donations Base Functionality
+ This feature was chosen for demonstration of the tech stack as it is perhaps the most crucial feature of the application. It is the only feature that writes to the database (firestore). It allows for interaction with the UI on the front end (react native) that communicates to the backend (javascript), ensuring the entire stack's proficiency is demonstrated for our application's 0.0.0 release.


### Bug Fixes
-N/A
### Known Issues
- Becasue our application is being developed for mobile platforms, Expo's development server on the web is not optimized and has some broken UI. However, the application, for the purposes of the artifact demo, works on mobile.
